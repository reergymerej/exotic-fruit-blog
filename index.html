        <p>
          jackfruit is a large fruit that tastes savory. it has small spikes
          smaller than it's look-alike cousin, the durian. it's seeds are like
          enormous corn kernels! and there's pulp that you have to get through.
          below. it has an enormous size! jackfruit wood is used in hawaiian
          surfboards before captain cook discovered the islands in 1976.

        <p>

pawpaws, like bananas are herbs, not trees. they consist many seeds which taste
peppery. mom made pawpaw chocolate cake 2 times! they usually suprise with their
unusual fruit arrangement. it's fair to call it a tree. it's also known as a
lechosa, grass mango, or papaya.
