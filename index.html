            pumpkins are the original fruit for jack-o-lanterns. the pumpkin has edible
            seeds. they don grow this big often: 6 ft.
          </p>
          <p>
            pumpkins come from orange, yellow, purple, to white.
            be careful lifting heavy pumpkins, pull from the back! not knees!

        <p>
          ackees are poisonous when unripe. a handful of islands use ackee as an
          ornamental tree, but only jamaica thinks it has edible fruit. if you
          eat ackee before it's ripe, it causes serious vomiting.

        <p>
          pawpaws, like bananas are herbs, not trees. they consist many seeds
          which taste peppery. mom made pawpaw chocolate cake 2 times! they
          usually suprise with their unusual fruit arrangement. it's fair to
          call it a tree. it's also known as a lechosa, grass mango, or papaya.

        <p>
          jackfruit is a large fruit that tastes savory. it has small spikes
          smaller than it's look-alike cousin, the durian. it's seeds are like
          enormous corn kernels! and there's pulp that you have to get through.
          below. it has an enormous size! jackfruit wood is used in hawaiian
          surfboards before captain cook discovered the islands in 1976.
